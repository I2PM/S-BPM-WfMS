# S-BPM Modelling and Execution Platform #

This is a modelling and execution platform for S-BPM processes, based on microservices powered by Spring Boot. The modelling platform is based on Angular 1, the frontend for the execution platform, however, is based on Angular 2.
Basically, the platform consists of the following modules:
 - **ServiceDiscovery:** Automatic detection of devices and services.
 - **ConfigurationService:** Central repository for configuration files.
 - **ProcessModelStorage:** This is the process repository.
 - **ProcessEngine:** Responsible for the execution of processes, based on Akka.
 - **EventLogger:** Logs events during execution, exports logs in CSV format, manipulates PNML files and transforms manipulated PNML files to OWL files.
 - **Gateway:** Authentication and authorization service and handles the requests of the process execution frontend (GUI).
 - **Persistence:** Hibernate mapping of the database tables.
 - **ExternalCommunicator:** For the support of external projects.
 - **GUI-Dev:** Development project for the Angular 2 execution platform frontend (With some dev tools, with node server backend).
 - **GUI:** Production project for the Angular 2 execution platform frontend (minified, uglified, with Spring Boot backend).
 - **ModellingPlatform-Dev:** Development project for the Angular 1 modelling platform frontend (with node server backend).
 - **ModellingPlatform:** Production project for the Angular 1 modelling platform frontend (with Spring Boot backend).

> A new version of the S-BPM modelling platform is available [here](https://github.com/mkolodiy/s-bpm-modeler).

## Master theses ##
In this section you will find Master's theses, which provide further information about the project.

 - Development of a Microservice-based Architecture for Storing and Executing Subject-oriented Processes (german) by Stefan Stani [Link](master_theses/MA-Stani-Stefan.pdf) 

## Setup ##
### Prerequisites ###

 - Java Platform (JDK) 8
 - MySQL 5.1-5.7
 
**Development only:**
 - NodeJS for Angular development in GUI-Dev and ModellingPlatform-Dev
 - Gulp for Angular development in ModellingPlatform-Dev

### Database Settings ###
Please execute following statements to create the schema and the db user in your MySQL database:
[DB_setup.sql](Setup/DB_setup.sql)

## Startup ##
### Start everything (Windows) ###
 1. Start the MySQL Service
 2. Go to [Setup/start_windows](Setup/start_windows)
 3. Open [start.bat](Setup/start_windows/start.bat)

### Execution Platform ###
 1. Start the MySQL Service
 2. Go to ServiceDiscovery and run in cmd:
 ```gradlew bootRun```
 3. Go to ConfigurationService and run in cmd:
 ```gradlew bootRun```
 4. Go to ProcessModelStorage and run in cmd: 
 ```gradlew bootRun```
 5. Go to ProcessEngine and run in cmd: 
 ```gradlew bootRun```
 6. Go to Gateway and run in cmd: 
 ```gradlew bootRun```
 7. Go to ExternalCommunicator and run in cmd: 
 ```gradlew bootRun```
 8. Go to EventLogger and run in cmd: 
 ```gradlew bootRun```
 9. Go to GUI and run in cmd: 
 ```gradlew bootRun```
 10. Go to ```http://localhost:3000```
 
### Modelling Platform ###
 1. Go to ModellingPlatform and run in cmd: 
 ```gradlew bootRun```
 2. Go to ```http://localhost:4000```
 
#### Alternative ####
If you prefer to run the jar files, without using gradlew:
 1. Go to [builds](builds)
 2. run in cmd: ```java -jar ModellingPlatform-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar```
 3. Go to ```http://localhost:4000```
 


### GUI-Dev ###
Just for development purposes, not for production!
 1. run in cmd: ```npm install```
 2. Go to GUI-Dev and run in cmd: ```npm start```
 3. in case of any errors when starting the first time, please stick to the installation guide of [ng2-admin](https://github.com/akveo/ng2-admin/)
 4. Go to ```http://localhost:3000```

### ModellingPlatform-Dev ###
Just for development purposes, not for production!
 1. Run ```npm install -g yo bower grunt-cli gulp && npm install && bower install``` to install required dependencies.
 2. Go to ModellingPlatform-Dev and run in cmd: ```npm install && bower install```
 3. Run in cmd: ```gulp serve```
 4. Go to ```http://localhost:3000```
 
## Configuration ##

### Ports ###
Basically, the following ports are used:

|  Service  |  Port  |
|  -------  |  ----- |
|  Gateway  |  10000 |
|  ServiceDiscovery  |  8761 |
|  ConfigurationService  |  8888 |
|  ProcessModelStorage  |  Random  |
|  ProcessEngine  |  Random  |
|  ExternalCommunicator | Random |
|  EventLogger  | Random |
|  GUI  |  3000  |
|  ModellingPlatform  |  4000  |

To change the port configuration, change the server port in this file e.g. Gateway: [application.properties] (Gateway/src/main/resources/application.properties)

**Note:** If you change the port of the Gateway, make sure to change the restApi configuration in [processes.service.ts](GUI-Dev/src/app/processes.service.ts) and to rebuild the GUI-Dev and GUI project according to the guide provide [below](#gui).

### User Configuration ###
In general, the authentication concept ist based on RBAC. Each user can be assigned to one or more roles. Each role can be assigned to one more rules.

The current *.csv files for the user configuration:
- [users.csv](Gateway/src/main/resources/memoryusers/users.csv)
- [roles.csv](Gateway/src/main/resources/memoryusers/roles.csv)
- [rules.csv](Gateway/src/main/resources/memoryusers/rules.csv)

##### Standard configuration: #####

|  User  |  Roles  |  Password  |
|  ----  |  -----  |  --------  |
|  robert  |  BOSS  |  1234  |
|  matthias  |  ADMIN, EMPLOYEE  |  1234  |
|  stefan  |  EMPLOYEE  |  1234  |
|  maksym  |  EMPLOYEE  |  1234  |
|  marlene |  TRAVEL MANAGEMENT | 1234 |

## Development ##
### Spring Boot Modules ###
Any further development concerning the ServiceDiscovery, the ConfigurationService, the Gateway, the ProcessModelStorage, the ExternalCommunicator or the ProcessEngine can be done directly in java. For further information please use the [Spring Boot Documentation](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/)

**Note:** If you do any changes to a module, you have to rebuild it with ```gradlew build```

### GUI ###
Any further development concerning the GUI has to be done in the GUI-Dev module by using typescript and Angular 2. For further information please use the [Angular Documentation](https://angular.io/) and the [ng2-admin Documentation](https://akveo.github.io/ng2-admin/articles/001-getting-started/).

**Note:** If you do any changes to the GUI-Dev project, you have to update the GUI project afterwards:
 1. Go to GUI-Dev and run in cmd: ```npm run prebuild:prod && npm run build:prod```
 2. Go to [GUI/src/main/resources/public/](GUI/src/main/resources/public/) and remove of all of its content.
 3. Go to [GUI-Dev/dist](GUI-Dev/dist) and move all of its content to [GUI/src/main/resources/public/](GUI/src/main/resources/public/).
 4. Go to [GUI](GUI) and run ```gradlew build``` or ```gradlew run```
 
### ModellingPlatform ###
Any further development concerning the ModellingPlatform has to be done in the ModellingPlatform-Dev module by using javascript and Angular 1.

**Note:** If you do any changes to the ModellingPlatform-Dev project, you have to update the ModellingPlatform project afterwards:
 1. Go to ModellingPlatform-Dev and run in cmd: ```gulp build```
 2. Go to [ModellingPlatform/src/main/resources/public/](ModellingPlatform/src/main/resources/public/) and remove of all of its content.
 3. Go to [ModellingPlatform-Dev/dist](ModellingPlatform-Dev/dist) and move all of its content to [ModellingPlatform/src/main/resources/public/](ModellingPlatform/src/main/resources/public/).
 4. Go to [ModellingPlatform](ModellingPlatform) and run ```gradlew build``` or ```gradlew run```
 
**Note:** You can change the appearance of the elements by modify the following file: [ui-joint-shape.template.scss](ModellingPlatform-dev/src/app/components/services/ui-joint/ui-joint-shape/ui-joint-shape.template.scss)
